# CKHH University Course Planner

## Overview 

Our project is a web-based application university course planner for students at CKHH University. The application is designed to handle a large number of students. CKHH University has over 10,000 students, and we expect that our application will be used by a significant portion of the student body. Our application will allow students to easily plan their upcoming term. The planner provides students with information about courses, professors, class locations, and class times and coursesâ€™ availability. This allows students to create a personalized schedule that meets their needs while at the same time allowing them to be better prepared for the upcoming term. 
Our application will include the following features:

Course search: Students can search for courses by title, or professor.
Course information: The planner provides detailed information about each course, including prerequisites, credits, and descriptions.
Professor information: The planner provides information about each professor, including the class they teach and their office location.
Class location and time: The planner shows students where and when each class is offered.
Schedule builder: Students can use the schedule builder to create a personalized schedule.
Schedule preview: Students can preview their schedule to see how their weekdays will be like when the term starts

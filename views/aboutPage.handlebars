            This project was our attempt to solidy our knowledge on dealing with relatoinal databases and linking up a website with a DBMS (Database Mangement System) - in this case, we are specifically making use of MariaDB.
            <ul style="margin-left: 3rem;">
                <li>As of now, the website allows users to register students, add schedules, and courses for each of the students.</li>
                <li>It also allows users to register professors, classrooms, and courses.</li>
                <li>Users can also view all the schedules in the entire database.</li>
                <li>Each page also has helpful instructions and links to help users get familiar with the site faster</li>
            </ul>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem;">
            Our application will include the following features:
            <ul style="margin-left: 3rem;">
                <li>Students information: The planner provides details about each student</li>
